Overview

In my first project for the General Assembly Software Engineering Flex course, I was given the task of building an arcade game. I decided to choose to create Tetris for two reasons. Firstly, I was keen to test myself and, secondly, I am a fan of the game.


Brief

- Render a game in the browser
- Use JavaScript, CSS and HTML
- Use JavaScript for DOM manipulation
- Deploy the game using GitHub pages

Game Requirements

- The game should stop if a Tetrimino fills the highest row of the game board
- The player should be able to rotate each Tetrimino about its own axis
- If a line is completed it should be removed and the pieces above should take its place
- The game should stop if a Tetrimino fills the highest row of the game board
- The player should be able to rotate each Tetrimino about its own axis
- If a line is completed it should be removed and the pieces above should take its place


Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Git
- GitHub Pages


Method Undertaken

- When a start button is pressed a 10 x 20 grid is created
  - I created 200 divs and added a class to them to create my grid

- I created my Tetriminos by setting the axis point of the Tetrimino as the current location and then created the other three cells from that point
